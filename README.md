# Neuroradiology-Interventional-Centers  

This repository contains the resulting itneractive figures of the geographic coverage of interventional neuroradiology centers in Germany. The study assesses accessibility based on isochrone calculations and population coverage estimates.  

## Overview  

- **Objective:** Evaluate the spatial distribution and accessibility of neurointerventional centers.  
- **Methods:** Geospatial analysis using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, isochrone calculations with openrouteservice, and population coverage estimation with the Global Human Settlement Population Grid (GHS-POP).  
- **Visualization:** Interactive figures displaying results from the analysis.  

## Results  

The results will be made available as part of the corresponding research paper (**placeholder**).
